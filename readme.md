# Ebetshot 에벳셧

A video screenshot extension for Chrome.

Bug me on discord if you encounter any issues.

## Get the Chrome Extension

You can easily download Ebetshot from the Chrome Web Store at this link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ebetshot-%EC%97%90%EB%B2%B3%EC%85%A7/imhioeojmeppiofbppalcignahcckijc

## Manual Installation

Want to use a prerelease version of Ebetshot before it's available on the Chrome Web Store?

Click on Releases tab on the right or just follow the link https://github.com/balduvian/ebetshot/releases.

Download the zip file from the latest available release.

Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file into a folder. Place that folder somewhere where you can remember.

Open up Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.

In the top right hand corner, enable the toggle for "Developer mode." Now 3 more buttons become available to the left.

Click on "Load unpacked" and navigate the the extracted folder. Then click "Select Folder."

Ebetshot should now appear in your extensions list!

## Note for Netflix

Netflix tries to prevent screenshotting. To get around this, the extension will instead ask for you to share your screen. For the best results, please choose "Chrome Tab" then find the tab the video is on in the screen share popup. When screenshotting in this mode, you will notice the background of the page become black for a split second.

Also of note is that chrome behaves erratically with screenshare sometimes. On netflix you may encounter a pink-screen when screenshare becomes enabled. If this happens, just try to play the video and the issue should resolve itself. Other times I've experienced the whole chrome window flashing for a few seconds before returning to normal.

This mode is also used when videos come from a cross origin site. An example is https://www.languagereactor.com/, where the videos come from Youtube.
