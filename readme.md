A video screenshot extension for Chrome.

### How to Install

Click on Releases tab on the right or just follow the link https://github.com/balduvian/ebetshot/releases.

Open up Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.

In the top right hand corner, enable the toggle for "Developer mode." Now 3 more buttons become available to the left.

Click on "Load unpacked" and navigate the the extracted folder. Then click "Select Folder."
